=======
IF HAVING ISSUES, REDEPLOY HERE:
Navigate to your directory using the command line, the master branch should already have azd installed, if it doesn't you can check with azd version.
then use the command azd auth login
this command lets you sign into Azure, and deploy the project after authorizing. 
then use the command azd up, which will hook up the project and post it onto the site.
You have to select a Subscription, then a Location. The Subscription should be Azure for Students, and the location is any, doesn't matter much.

OTHERWISE:

this link directs to the deployment page I have, simply hit Redeploy here and it should update the site.
